           Semester/Year: Third Semester
           Software: Stop Motion Animation and Audacity
           The inspiration for this project was thinking about my character’s style and how she gets ready for performances. I made it my own by applying my own makeup skills to the project and enhancing the video by creating an environment that I’d imagine Celestia would preside in. I decided to make animation short and add audio through audacity. My video is about Celestia applying makeup onto her face and I used stop motion and audacity techniques. The first storyboard I created was for a music video, but I changed my mind and decided to create an animated short.</p>
