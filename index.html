	<h1>Biography of Celestia Loveland</h1>
    <p>My character’s name is Celestia Loveland, she is 21, 5’10” and has an athletic slim body. Her hair is pastel pink and cut in a shaggy bob, though her head is often covered by a pink and red jester hat. The hat is split half red half light pink, with red hearts on the pink side, and pink heart-shaped bells on each end of the hat. Her skin is pale, but she often wears clown makeup. She wears a white and pink tulle ruffled collar around her neck.</p>
