      <h1>What is Celestia like?</h1>
      <p>Celestia is bubbly and energetic, she moves freely with traces of elegance. As an acrobatic and a trapeze artist, Celestia is comfortable with her body and loves to stay active on her feet. She’s very jumpy but not clumsy, she never falls or stumbles. She’s an extremely passionate person who cares about those around her, her circus troupe has become like her new family. She puts her all into performing, she wants to inspire those around her and put on the best show for the audience. She’s confident in her work but doesn’t have a huge ego nor does she place herself above anyone else. What she’s most scared of still is losing those around her, not being able to protect her loved ones, and being discovered by the officials who destroyed Loveland. Though she’s fearless when it comings to fighting for others and inspiring them, she is insecure about if she’s a good enough friend. </p>
